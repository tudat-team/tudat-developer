# GitHub in the Tudat Ecosystem
---

Welcome to the [`tudat-team` organization on GitHub](https://github.com/tudat-team)! The `tudat-team` uses GitHub as its primary Version Control System (VCS), project management tool, and platform for general feature discussions. The organization is dedicated to the development and maintenance of the tudat ecosystem, which aims to facilitate astrodynamics and space research. This overview introduces each repository in the `tudat-team` organization.

In addition to serving as our VCS, GitHub Actions are extensively used for DevOps within the `tudat-team`. More information on this can be found in other sections of the documentation.
