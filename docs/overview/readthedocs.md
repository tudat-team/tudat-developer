# Release an online version

Every time you make a modification to the documentation, you are
required to:

1.  branch out from develop to a `feature/FEATURE_NAME` branch (see
    `Code Collaboration`)
2.  make the necessary modifications (see `Sphinx Documentation`)
3.  test the build locally (see `Sphinx Documentation)`
4.  update the `CHANGELOG.md`
5.  open a Pull Request into `develop` (see `Code Collaboration`)
6.  issue an unstable version of the documentation (see
    `Release Versioning`)

The reviewer is required to:

1.  review the pull request by testing it locally
2.  if needed, ask the developer for modifications
3.  merge into develop, push and check the result online (`latest`
    version)
4.  release a stable version with `bumpversion`
5.  merge develop into master to deploy a `stable` version of the docs

To host our online documentation, like the one you are reading, we use
[readthedocs](https://readthedocs.org).

## Deploying a version with `readthedocs`

<div class="seealso">

In this guide, we assume that the reader is familiar with how to release
new versions of the documentation locally through `bumpversion` (see
`bump_version`).

</div>

Readthedocs uses git tags to build different versions of the
documentation, with two additional versions:

- `latest` (corresponding to the latest commit on `develop`)
- `stable` (corresponding to the most recent version released on
  `master`)

<div id="readthedocs_menu">

<div class="title">

Note

</div>

The landing pages for both tudat-space and the developer docs point to
the `stable` version. It is still possible to switch to `latest` through
the readthedocs panel (bottom left of the page, as shown below).

Once commits are pushed to the `develop` branch on `origin` (or a new
version tag is pushed to `main`), the documentation is built
automatically by [readthedocs](readthedocs.org). If changes are pushed
to other branches, no documentation is built.

### Stable vs. unstable versions

Depending whether the release is stable or unstable, different things
happen:

- if the release is *stable* (e.g., v0.1.2), the resulting documentation
  is published on the website and a new version will be visible in the
  readthedocs menu)
- if the release is *unstable* (e.g., v0.1.2dev0), the resulting
  documentation will not be built nor published on the website

### Activating unstable versions

Unpublished versions, such as unstable versions or versions from other
branches, can still be activated by authorized users (i.e., readthedocs
maintainers) to be viewed online and shared with others through a link.
This can be done by clicking on the readthedocs menu and selecting
"Builds", then "Versions" and activate build. Make it hidden to avoid it
being listed on the website and searchable by the users.

Clicking on the right build allows to see it in the browser and copy the
related link to share it with collaborators. This is particularly useful
to share drafts of the output documentation without modifying stable
versions.

### How different versions are used in tudat

This is how we envisage different versions of the online docs:

- the `stable` documentation with proper versioning is the official
  documentation and can be linked to different software versions
- the `latest` documentation is useful to deploy documentation quickly
  and, if needed, also use it for giving/receiving feedback
- the inactive documentation (corresponding to unstable versions or
  other branches) can be used for giving/receiving feedback, but they
  have to be activated and hidden by maintainers of readthedocs

## Troubleshooting

In this section, we collect the most recurring bugs that can happen
while using `readthedocs`, hoping that it will save precious time to
future Tudat contributors.

### No changes shown in online docs

It can happen that, after pushing your changes to the `origin`
repository, no changes are shown on the actual website (e.g., on
tudat-space or on this website). Some suggestions to identify the
problem will follow:

1.  Check that you pushed to the `main` branch. The documentation is
    built by readthedocs only if changes are pushed to that branch.
2.  Check that the build was successful. This can be monitored via the
    "Builds" link in the [readthedocs_menu](#readthedocs_menu) (see
    screenshot above). If the build was not successful, you can click on
    it and see the output of the build. This can be helpful to identify
    where things are going wrong.
