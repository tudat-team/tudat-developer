# Di치taxis Framework

The Di치taxis framework is a systematic approach to technical documentation
that was developed to address the challenge of structuring documentation in
a clear and logical way. The framework consists of four distinct modes of
documentation, each of which serves a distinct user need and requires a
unique approach to creation.

| Mode                              | Focus                  | Purpose                                                                                                |
|-----------------------------------|------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| [Tutorials](#tutorials)           | Learning-oriented      | Used to teach new users how to use a product or technology.                                            |
| [How-To Guides](#how-to-guides)   | Problem-oriented       | Provide solutions to specific problems or use cases.                                                   |
| [Technical Reference](#reference) | Information-oriented   | Provides detailed information on the features, functions, and capabilities of a product or technology. |
| [Explanation](#explanation)       | Understanding-oriented | Provides conceptual information and context to help users understand a product or technology.          |

By adopting the Di치taxis framework, technical writers can ensure that their
documentation is tailored to the user's needs and provides the information
they need in a clear and concise manner. The framework has gained
widespread adoption in the technical writing community and is considered a
best practice for creating effective technical documentation.


## Tutorials

Tutorials walk users through a process or task step-by-step. They should be
structured in a clear and logical way, with each step building on the
previous one. Tutorials should also include visuals and examples to help
users understand the process.

> **Example**:
> A tutorial on how to create a new user account in a software application.

!!! remember
    - Clearly state the learning objective
    - Break down the task into clear and concise steps
    - Use images, diagrams, and examples to aid understanding
    - Provide feedback and reinforcement to encourage learning

## How-To Guides

How-to guides provide solutions to specific problems or use cases. They
should be focused and concise, providing clear and actionable steps to
solve the problem.

> **Example**:
> A how-to guide on how to troubleshoot a connectivity issue with a
> networking device.

!!! remember
    - Clearly state the problem or use case
    - Provide a clear and concise solution
    - Use screenshots or other visuals to help users understand the solution
    - Test the solution to ensure it works as expected

## Technical Reference

Technical reference documentation provides detailed information on the
features, functions, and capabilities of a product or technology. It should
be well-organized and easy to navigate, with a clear and concise
description of each feature or function.

> **Example**:
> Technical reference documentation for a software library, detailing each
> of
> its APIs and functions.

!!! remember
    - Clearly define each feature or function
    - Provide detailed information on each feature or function, including
      syntax, parameters, and return values
    - Organize the information in a clear and logical manner
    - Provide examples of how to use each feature or function

## Explanation

Explanation provides conceptual information and context to help users
understand a product or technology. It should be clear and concise,
providing context and explanation in a way that is easy to understand.

> **Example**:
> An explanation of the importance of project documentation and an overview
> of the Di치taxis framework.

!!! remember
    - Provide high-level overviews of the product or technology
    - Provide conceptual information and context to help users understand the
      product or technology
    - Explain why the product or technology is important and how it fits into
      the broader technology landscape
    - Use analogies or other relatable examples to aid understanding
